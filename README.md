## Machin Learning Models for customer_dataset

* [python codes for costumer dataset](https://github.com/E008001/ML_customer_data_notebook/blob/master/customer-one-hot.ipynb)
## Dataset  
The dataset includes data from 89973 customer with 10 features  
1-Customer income  
2-First Buy Data  
3-Last Buy Data  
4- Average Buy Amount  
5- Frequency Level  
6- Buy Amount Grade  
7- Special Buyer  
8- Last Buy Amount  
9- Buy Amount Average  
10- class  

## The Problem  

 Given a number of elements of customers of a store with certain features, we want to build a machine learning model to identify that  
 who responce to the Advertising Campaign accourding to the "class" column.  
   
   To solve the problem we will have to analyse the data, do any required chaneged, normalisation, apply a machine learning algorithm, train a model, check the performance of the trained model and iterate with other algorithms until we find the best model.
